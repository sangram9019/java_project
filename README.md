# 📚 Simple Library Management System (Java Console App)

This is a **basic Library Management System** built using Java. It is a console-based application that allows users to manage a collection of books by performing actions like adding new books, viewing the collection, issuing and returning books, and searching for a book by title.

## 🚀 Features

- Add a book with ID, title, and author.
- View the list of all books with their availability status.
- Search for a book by its title.
- Issue a book by its ID.
- Return a previously issued book.
- Simple and user-friendly console interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

The application consists of three main classes:

- **`Book.java`**: Represents a book with fields like `id`, `title`, `author`, and `isIssued`.
- **`Library.java`**: Contains the logic for managing the book collection, including add, search, issue, and return operations.
- **`main.java`**: The main class with a menu-driven console interface for interacting with the user.
